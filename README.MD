# Domain2Ellipse
A Pointwise Glyph script that demonstrates how the perimeter of any 
domain can be changed into a planar ellipse. The original idea for this
implementation is from Jason Davies, From Random Polygon to Ellipse,
http://www.jasondavies.com/random-polygon-ellipse/.

Note: This script should not delete or change your original grid but
may leave behind many database curves.
